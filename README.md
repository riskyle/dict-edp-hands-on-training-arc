This is a **structured 30-day programming challenge** that walks step by step through all the required topics, starting from fundamentals and gradually building into **real-world integrations** (like file + DB CRUD apps).

This plan assumes need to invest **1–2 hours per day** (more if you want to dive deeper).

# 📌 Additional Notes

* **Prerequisites:** Basic programming environment set up (C++/Java/C#/VB.NET + DB like SQLite/MySQL).
* **Daily Time Investment:** 1–2 hours.
* **Testing:** Use edge cases (empty input, max input, invalid data).
* **Best Practices:**

  * Comment your code.
  * Modularize into functions/classes.
  * Always validate input.
  * Use version control (Git) if possible.

👉 By the end of **30 days**, you’ll have built multiple mini-projects and a **capstone Student Management System**, covering **all 7 topics in an integrated way**.

Would you like me to also create a **printable calendar-style roadmap** (Day 1–30 checklist format) so you can tick off progress visually?
