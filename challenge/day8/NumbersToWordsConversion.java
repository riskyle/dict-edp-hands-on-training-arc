	/* Day 8 – Numbers → Words Conversion
	 * Challenge: Convert an integer (up to trillions) into English words. 
	   Example input: 1,250,230,321,900 → One Trillion Two Hundred Fifty Billion 
	   Two Hundred Thirty Million Three Hundred Twenty-One Thousand Nine Hundred.
	 * Objectives: Large-number grouping (thousands, millions, billions, trillions),
	   handling zero, proper grammar.
	 * Success Criteria: Correct English-word representation for edge cases: 0, 11–19,
	   hundreds with zeros (e.g., 100, 1,000,010).
	 * Hints: Break number into groups of three digits (units, thousands, millions, ...),
	   convert each group, then append scale words.
